# Aviation dosimetry validation

## Introduction

Everyday cosmic radiation enters the Earth's atmosphere, significant amount of this radiation is made up of gamma rays. 

This validation study will be comparing data modeled from the Amentum API with data gathered in Western Australia in a University of Sydney study. (Possibly also a California study, not sure yet).
This study will validate the API's ability to model gamma radiation in Earth's atmosphere.

## Aim

To validate the Amentum Ray API by comparing experimental data obtained during ascent of a balloon against model prediction

## Run the analysis

Run the analysis script by entering the following in a terminal

        python example.py

## Results and discussion

Include the main result image here

#First draft
#Might be adding the California study
The difference between data gathered from the API and data gathered from the Sdney uni experiment are orders of magnitude different. A logarmithmic y axis was used so the results plotted in a nicer looking way.
Though the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum can be seen in both sets of data. This
